</span><span class="c2">The amount of crowdsourced geospatial content on the Web is con- stantly increasing, providing a wealth of information for a variety of location-based services and applications. This content can be an- alyzed to discover interesting locations in large urban environments which people choose for different purposes, such as for entertain- ment, shopping, business or culture. In this paper, we focus on the problem of identifying and describing Streets of Interest. Given the road network in a specified area, and a collection of geolo- cated Points of Interest and photos in this area, our goal is to iden- tify the most interesting streets for a specified category or keyword set, and to allow their visual exploration by selecting a small and spatio-textually diverse set of relevant photos. We formally define the problem and we present efficient algorithms, based on spatio- textual indices and filter and refinement strategies. The proposed methods are evaluated experimentally regarding their effectiveness and efficiency, using three real-world datasets containing road net- works, POIs and photos collected from several Web sources. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">1. INTRODUCTION </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A large amount of user-generated content is becoming avail- able on the Web daily, with increasingly large portions of it be- ing associated with geospatial information. Typical examples in- clude maps of road networks and other spatial features available on OpenStreetMap and Wikimapia, information about Points of In- terest (POIs) from Wikipedia and Foursquare, geotagged photos from Flickr and Panoramio. This creates a valuable resource for discovering and exploring locations and areas of interest, with nu- merous applications in location-based services, geomarketing, trip planning, and other domains. In this paper, we advocate the use of street as the elemental area of interest in modern cities, and tackle two complementary problems, identifying and describing them. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Regarding the first task, there has been substantial work in iden- tifying a single POI, based on spatial and textual criteria. More precisely, spatio-textual similarity queries, aim at retrieving POIs that are both spatially close to a given location and textually rele- vant to a given set of keywords specifying an information need [9]. Additional metadata associated to the POIs, such as ratings, com- ments, &ldquo;likes&rdquo; or check-ins, can be considered to weigh the impor- </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">c </span><span class="c25">2016, Copyright is with the authors.

The proximity of a POI to other relevant POIs has also been considered as a factor indicating importance [5]. Furthermore, in Location-Based Social Networks, information about social connectivity is also considered in determining the importance of POIs (and users) [4, 2]. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A line of work more related to our first task deals with discov- ering a set of nearby and topically related POIs, that designate a Region of Interest. This is a more challenging problem, and pro- posals mainly differ in the way regions are formed. The majority of past research addresses the maximum range sum problem, where the region is defined as either a rectangle of fixed length and width [21, 24, 10], or a disk with fixed radius [10], and the objective is to find the one that maximizes an aggregate importance score on the topically relevant POIs it contains. Other works do not enforce a constraint on region shape or size, and rather implement density- based clustering of POIs [20, 19]. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">All aforementioned works assume that POIs are located in a Eu- clidean space. However, particularly in urban environments, it is often more realistic and useful to consider the underlying road net- work. Grouping together nearby POIs makes little sense if the ac- tual travel distance between them is large, e.g., when they are lo- cated in opposite banks of a river. Surprisingly, little work is done in this frontier. In [7], the authors look for a connected subgraph of the road network that maximizes an aggregate score on the relevant POIs that are included, subject to a constraint on its total length. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Nonetheless, such an approach also has shortcomings. First, the fact that there is no control on the subgraph type may result in re- turning oddly-shaped regions that are hard to inspect and not par- ticularly meaningful in a user exploration setting. Additionally, the approach favors POI quantity over density. More often than not, there exists a single popular street with a high density of POIs. Us- ing the formulation of [7], such a street would be in the result but accompanied by several other smaller adjacent streets that happen to have at least one relevant POI. Similarly, looking for connected components may lead to discovering artificial links among impor- tant streets for the sole purpose of ensuring connectivity. Another limitation is that [7] assumes POIs are conveniently situated on the road network as vertices. In reality, however, the situation is much different. Figure 1(a) shows the map of a popular corner (Oxford Str. and Regent Str.) in the center of London, and also depicts var- ious types of POIs. It should be apparent that there is no straight- forward mapping of POIs to the road network vertices. Instead, it is more natural to &ldquo;assign&rdquo; POIs to edges (streets) but not necessar- ily in an exclusive manner. For example a POI (e.g., the clothing shop in Figure 1(a)) near the corner should be associated with both intersecting streets. Moreover, a POI (e.g., the photo shop in Fig- ure 1(a)) farther from the streets but inside a corner building should also contribute to the importance of the main crossing streets. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26">Series ISSN: 2367-2005 437 </span><span class="c96">10.5441/002/edbt.2016.40 </span></p><p class="c64"><span class="c2">(c) Photo description of Oxford Street </span></p><p class="c1 c130"><span class="c2">(a) Street segments and POIs </span></p><p class="c1 c98"><span class="c2">(b) Top-20 Streets of Interest </span></p><p class="c1 c98"><span class="c2">(b) Top-20 Streets of Interest </span></p><p class="c124"><span class="c2">Figure 1: Illustrative example for shopping streets in the center of London. </span></p><p class="c114"><span class="c2">Motivated by these observations, we formulate the problem of identifying Streets of Interest (SOIs). Briefly, given some textual information (keywords, categories) the goal is to identify the streets (more accurately the street segments) that have a large density of relevant POIs around them. An example for the center of London is illustrated in Figure 1(b), where the top 20-SOIs are highlighted with red. Notice that the returned streets are not connected via non-interesting streets. Moreover, our ranking approach naturally allows for an exploratory search of the area. To efficiently retrieve a ranked list of SOIs, we propose an algorithm inspired from top-k query processing that operates on top of spatio-textual indices. </span></p><p class="c100"><span class="c2">Although very helpful, identifying the main SOIs for the user&rsquo;s keywords is only the first step towards exploring a larger area. Typ- ically, the user then needs to find more information and gain more insights about those results that are discovered and suggested. For this purpose, perhaps the easiest and most effective way is by pro- viding visual information; thus, a valuable source is the numerous relevant photos that can be found in various Web sources, such as Flickr and Panoramio. The challenge that arises then is how to se- lect a small set of results to present, in order to avoid overloading the user, especially when using a mobile device with limited re- sources in terms of bandwidth, screen size and battery, while still providing enough information. This can be achieved by diversify- ing the results to present, so that more and different information can be conveyed with fewer results. </span></p><p class="c73"><span class="c2">To that end, the second task we address in this paper refers to the selection of a concise and spatio-textually diverse set of relevant photos for describing the discovered SOIs. We follow the general diversity principles from information retrieval [16, 8], and formu- late a spatio-textual SOI diversification problem. In particular, we introduce spatial and textual measures of relevance and diversity, and seek to extract a small set of photos that act as an informative summary of a given SOI (see the example in Figure 1(c) for a 4- photo summary of Oxford Str). As this is a computationally hard problem, we turn into heuristic methods supported by appropriate spatio-textual indices. </span></p><p class="c14"><span class="c2">The main contributions of our work can be summarized as fol- lows:</span><span class="c5">&bull; We formally define the top-k SOI query, and we present an </span></p><p class="c75"><span class="c2">efficient algorithm for its evaluation. </span></p><p class="c160"><span class="c2">&bull; We present spatio-textual relevance and diversity criteria for selecting subsets of available photos to describe SOIs, and we propose an efficient approximation algorithm for their computation. </span></p><p class="c54"><span class="c2">&bull; We present the results of an experimental evaluation of our proposed methods, using real-world datasets containing road </span></p><p class="c1 c157"><span class="c2">networks, POIs and photos from several major Web sources, covering the areas of three different European capital cities. </span></p><p class="c129"><span class="c2">The rest of the paper is organized as follows.

RELATED WORK </span></p><p class="c63"><span class="c2">This section reviews existing approaches for spatio-textual POI retrieval and diversification. </span><span class="c10">2.1 Ranking Points and Areas of Interest </span></p><p class="c71"><span class="c2">Numerous works have focused on discovering and ranking points or areas of interest, based on various definitions and criteria. The main differences involve the following aspects: (a) whether the fo- cus is on single POIs or whole areas, i.e. sets of POIs; (b) whether the problem involves nearby search around a given query location or rather browsing and exploration within a whole area; (c) whether the aim is to maximize the number or the total score (e.g. relevance or importance) of the POIs enclosed in the discovered area or to minimize some cost function (e.g. distance or travel time) on a set of POIs that suffice for covering the query keywords. </span></p><p class="c79"><span class="c2">The majority of existing works focuses on the ranking of single POIs. Location-aware top-k text retrieval queries have been studied in [11]. Given the user location and a set of keywords, this query returns the top-k POIs ranked according to both their spatial prox- imity and their textual relevance to the query. For the efficient eval- uation of such queries, a hybrid indexing approach was proposed, integrating the inverted file for text retrieval and the R-tree for spa- tial proximity querying. Further variations on spatio-textual queries and indexes have been extensively studied [9]. Top-k spatial key- word queries have been studied also in [23], with distances being calculated on the road network instead of the Euclidean space. A different perspective for ranking POIs is taken in [5], where the im- portance of a POI takes into account the presence of other relevant nearby POIs. </span></p><p class="c20"><span class="c2">Queries involving sets of spatio-textual objects have been inves- tigated in [6, 27]. Given a set of keywords and, optionally, a user location, the goal is to identify sets of POIs that collectively satisfy the query keywords while minimizing the maximum distance or the sum of distances between each other and to the query. </span></p><p class="c122"><span class="c2">More recently, other works have focused on discovering regions </span></p><p class="c51"><span class="c26">438 </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">of interest w.r.t. a specified category or set of keywords, where the importance of a region is determined based on the number or the total weight of relevant POIs it contains. In [19], density-based clustering is applied to identify regions with high concentration of POIs of certain categories, collected and integrated from several Web sources. A method for extracting scenic routes from geo- tagged photos uploaded on sites such as Flickr and Panoramio is presented in [3]. Discovering and recommending regions of in- terest based on user-generated data is also addressed in [20]. The quality of a recommended area is determined based on the portion of the contained POIs that can be visited within a given time bud- get. Other variations of queries for discovering interesting regions include the subject-oriented top-k hot region query [21] and the maximizing range sum query [10]. The region is defined by a rect- angle or circle with a maximum size constraint, and the goal is to maximize the score of the relevant POIs contained in it. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The most closely related work to our approach is [7], which pro- poses the length-constrained maximum-sum region query. Given a set of POIs in an area and a set of keywords, this query computes a region that does not exceed a given size constraint and that max- imizes the score of the contained POIs that match the query key- words. The query assumes an underlying road network, in which the POIs are included as additional vertices, and the returned region has the form of a connected subgraph of this network with arbitrary shape. The problem is shown to be NP-hard, and approximation al- gorithms are proposed. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">This problem is similar to our setting; in both cases, the goal is to discover interesting parts of a road network that are associated with large number of POIs relevant to a given set of keywords. However, in [7], the result is a single connected subgraph of the road network, maximizing the score of contained points, while our method returns a ranked list of streets that are not necessarily connected and are ordered according to their density w.r.t. POIs relevant to the query. Moreover, we additionally consider the problem of describing these discovered streets by means of a diversified set of photos, which is not addressed in [7] or any of the other works mentioned before. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Finally, in a different line of research, other works have applied probabilistic topic modeling on user-generated spatio-textual data and events to associate urban areas with topics and patterns of user mobility and behavior [18, 15]. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">2.2 Search Results Diversification </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Information retrieval engines often try to improve the utility of the search results by taking into account not only their relevance to the user&rsquo;s query, but also their dissimilarity, offering thus a range of alternatives, which comes handy in situations where the true intent of the user is unknown or many highly similar objects exist. Stated in an abstract manner, the content-based diversification problem is to determine a set of objects that maximizes an objective function with two components, the relevance and the diversity. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">While there exist many different formulations (refer to [16, 13] for classification), the most well-known is the MaxSum problem, where the goal is to maximize the weighted sum of two compo- nents, the total relevance of objects, and the sum of pairwise di- versities among the objects. Similar to other diversification prob- lems, MaxSum is NP-hard as it is related to the dispersion problem [22]. Therefore, various greedy heuristics are proposed. Typically, they incrementally construct the diversified result set by choosing at each step the object that maximizes a certain scoring function. The most well-known function is the maximal marginal relevance (mmr) [8]. An evaluation of various object scoring functions and different heuristics can be found in [26]. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Since [8], several works addressed other diversification prob- </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">lems, such as taxonomy/classification-based diversification [1], [25] or multi-criteria diversification [12]. Another related work is the coverage problem [14], where the goal is to select a set of diverse objects that cover the entire database. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">3. IDENTIFYING STREETS OF INTEREST </span><span class="c2">We first formulate the problem of identifying interesting streets, and then present our proposed approach. </span><span class="c10">3.1 Problem Definition </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A road network is a directed graph G = (V,L), where the set of vertices V contains street intersections or breakpoints in streets, and the set of links L contains street segments (between intersections or breakpoints) represented as line segments. Each vertex v &isin; V is associated with its coordinates (x</span><span class="c12">v</span><span class="c2">,y</span><span class="c12">v</span><span class="c2">). The length len(l) of a segment l &isin; L is computed as the Euclidean distance between its endpoints. We also consider the set of streets S, where each street s &isin; S comprises a set of consecutive segments (a simple path on G). Each segment l &isin; L belongs to a unique street s, and we denote this relationship by l &isin; s. The length len(s) of street s is the sum of the length of its segments. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Moreover, we define an additional data source P, being a set of POIs. Each POI p &isin; P is defined by a tuple p = &#12296;(x</span><span class="c12">p</span><span class="c2">,y</span><span class="c12">p</span><span class="c2">),&Psi;</span><span class="c12">p</span><span class="c2">&#12297;, where (x</span><span class="c16">p</span><span class="c5">,y</span><span class="c16">p</span><span class="c5">) are the coordinates of the POI, and &Psi;</span><span class="c16">p </span><span class="c5">is a set </span><span class="c2">of keywords describing this POI (e.g., keywords derived from its name, description, tags). The distance dist(p, l) of a POI p to a line segment l is defined as the minimum Euclidean distance be- tween POI location (x</span><span class="c16">p</span><span class="c5">,y</span><span class="c16">p</span><span class="c5">) and any point on l. Accordingly, the </span><span class="c2">distance of POI p to a street s is the minimum distance of p to any segment of s, i.e., dist(p, s) = min</span><span class="c16">l&isin;s </span><span class="c5">dist(p, l). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">To measure the interest of a street segment w.r.t. a given set of keywords, we use the notion of mass, which refers to the number of relevant POIs that exist in its proximity. Then, we rank segments according to their mass density, to account also for the different lengths of each segment. We formally define these concepts below. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">D</span><span class="c37">EFINITION </span><span class="c2">1 (S</span><span class="c37">EGMENT MASS</span><span class="c2">). For a given set of keywords &Psi; and a distance threshold &epsilon;, the mass of segment l is the number of POIs within distance &epsilon; that contain at least one keyword from &Psi;: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">mass(l|&Psi;,&epsilon;) = |{p &isin; P : dist(p, l) &le; &epsilon; &amp; &Psi;</span><span class="c16">p </span><span class="c5">&cap; &Psi; = &empty;}|. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Note that this definition can be straightforwardly adapted in the case that POIs have different weights. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">D</span><span class="c37">EFINITION </span><span class="c2">2 (S</span><span class="c37">EGMENT INTEREST</span><span class="c2">). The interest of segment l is its mass density, i.e., the ratio of l&rsquo;s mass over the size of the area within distance &epsilon; around l: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">int(l |&Psi;,&epsilon;) = </span><span class="c13">mass(l|&Psi;,&epsilon;) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2&epsilon; len(l) + &pi;&epsilon;</span><span class="c0">2 </span><span class="c13">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Given this definition for the interest of a segment, there exist several alternatives for defining the interest of an entire street. Here, we use a simple definition, as stated below. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">D</span><span class="c37">EFINITION </span><span class="c2">3 (S</span><span class="c37">TREET INTEREST</span><span class="c2">). Given &Psi; and &epsilon;, the in- terest of a street s is the maximum interest among its segments, i.e.: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">int(s|&Psi;,&epsilon;) = max </span><span class="c16">l&isin;s </span><span class="c2">int(l|&Psi;,&epsilon;).

It pro- gressively examines segments of streets and POIs until it can es- tablish that the k-SOI can be determined solely from the informa- tion already collected. Specifically, </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">maintains a seen lower bound LB</span><span class="c12">k </span><span class="c2">on the interest of the k best streets encountered so far, and an unseen upper bound UB on the interest of any street for which no segment has been encountered yet. As more segments are considered, LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">progressively increases, while UB progres- </span><span class="c2">sively decreases. When LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">becomes not smaller than UB, the </span><span class="c2">examination stops, since the k-SOIs are those streets with interest not smaller than LB</span><span class="c16">k</span><span class="c5">. </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c2">Under the aforementioned strategy, there are two issues to ad- dress: (1) how to compute the seen lower bound LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">and the un- </span><span class="c2">seen upper bound UB, and (2) how to expedite the termination condition, LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">&ge; UB. </span></p><p class="c59"><span class="c2">We address the former first, as its solution gives intuition about the latter. Based on the definition of street interest (Equation 1), we can compute bounds on the interest of a street s by considering directly the segments. The following lemma suggests a method to compute LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">and UB; their exact definition is presented later. </span></p><p class="c142"><span class="c2">L</span><span class="c37">EMMA </span><span class="c2">1. Consider a subset of segments L</span><span class="c12">seen </span><span class="c2">&sube; L. Then, for a street s it holds that: </span></p><p class="c140"><span class="c2">int(s) &ge; max </span><span class="c16">l&isin;s&cap;L</span><span class="c19">seen </span><span class="c2">int(l), if s &cap; L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">= &empty; </span><span class="c2">int(s) &le; max </span><span class="c16">l&isin;L\L</span><span class="c19">seen </span><span class="c2">int(l), if s &cap; L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">= &empty;. </span></p><p class="c116"><span class="c2">P</span><span class="c37">ROOF</span><span class="c2">. For the first case observe that s &cap; L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">&sube; s, and thus </span><span class="c2">max</span><span class="c16">l&isin;s&cap;L</span><span class="c19">seen </span><span class="c2">int(l) &le; max</span><span class="c16">l&isin;s </span><span class="c5">int(l) = int(s). For the second </span><span class="c2">case observe that L\L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">&supe; s, and thus max</span><span class="c16">l&isin;L\L</span><span class="c19">seen </span><span class="c2">int(l) &ge; max</span><span class="c16">l&isin;s </span><span class="c5">int(l) = int(s). </span></p><p class="c161"><span class="c2">Consider a seen street s, meaning that one of its segments has been encountered, i.e., s &cap; L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">= &empty;. The first case of Lemma 1 </span><span class="c2">implies that a lower bound on the interest of s can be extracted from the largest interest of its seen segments, or, more practically, from the largest lower bound on the interest of any of its seen segments. On the other hand, consider an unseen street s, i.e., s &cap; L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">= </span><span class="c2">&empty;. The second case of Lemma 1 implies that an upper bound on the interest of s can be extracted from the largest possible interest among unseen segments, or, more practically, from an upper bound on the largest possible interest among unseen segments. </span></p><p class="c66"><span class="c2">In other words, Lemma 1 directly addresses the former issue. However, it also suggests how to address the latter. Suppose we have encountered a set of segments L</span><span class="c12">seen</span><span class="c2">. What segments should it contain so as to increase the chances of satisfying the termination condition? To obtain a high seen lower bound LB</span><span class="c16">k</span><span class="c5">, the first case </span><span class="c2">of Lemma 1 suggests putting in L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">segments with high interest. </span><span class="c2">Moreover, to obtain a small unseen upper bound UB, the second case of Lemma 1 suggests leaving out from L</span><span class="c16">seen </span><span class="c5">segments with </span></p><p class="c1 c153"><span class="c2">low interest. Therefore, the algorithm should try to visit segments with large interest first. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c2">As it is impractical to directly retrieve segments by interest (that would require precomputation for all possible k-SOI queries, i.e., for arbitrary &epsilon;, &Psi;), we need a way to identify promising segments having large interest. To this end, we employ the following data structures. </span></p><p class="c141"><span class="c2">&bull; A spatial grid index with arbitrary cell size storing all POIs. Within each cell c, there is a local inverted index on the set of keywords among the cell POIs. The entry for keyword &psi; is a list of POIs sorted increasingly on POI id. </span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c2">&bull; A global inverted index on the set of all keywords. The en- try for keyword &psi; is a list of &#12296;c,numPOIs&#12297; entries sorted decreasingly on numPOIs, which is the number of POIs within cell c that contain keyword &psi;. </span></p><p class="c107"><span class="c2">&bull; A cell-to-segment map that stores for each grid cell the seg- ments that pass through it. At query time when &epsilon; is known, the map is augmented to contain for each cell all segments that are within distance &epsilon;. We denote the augmented list for cell c as L</span><span class="c16">&epsilon;</span><span class="c5">(c). </span></p><p class="c84"><span class="c2">&bull; A segment-to-cell map that stores for each segment the grid cells that it intersects. At query time when &epsilon; is known, the map is augmented to contain for each segment all cells that are within distance &epsilon;. We denote the augmented list for seg- ment l as C</span><span class="c12">&epsilon;</span><span class="c2">(l). </span></p><p class="c88"><span class="c2">&bull; A list of segments sorted increasingly on their length. </span></p><p class="c153 c156"><span class="c2">Note that since street segments and POIs are relatively static, these data structures can be created and maintained offline. </span></p><p class="c97"><span class="c29">3.2.2 Algorithm Description </span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c2">In what follows, we discuss the case of a query specifying a sin- gle keyword, i.e., &Psi; = {&psi;}. Intuitively, we look for segments that have large mass and small len. Thus, given the above data struc- tures, we look for segments that (1) are close (within distance &epsilon;) to cells with large number of relevant POIs (satisfying &psi;), (2) are close to many cells, and (3) have small len. The first two factors combined contribute to the mass, while the third directly to len. Therefore, the algorithm considers segments according to the fol- lowing three ranked source lists constructed, in part, at query time. </span></p><p class="c21"><span class="c2">SL</span><span class="c12">1</span><span class="c2">: Contains all cells sorted decreasingly on the number of POIs with keyword &psi;. This is essentially the list of the global inverted index for keyword &psi;. </span></p><p class="c132"><span class="c2">SL</span><span class="c12">2</span><span class="c2">: Contains all segments sorted decreasingly on the number of cells within distance &epsilon; to them (the cells each segment inter- sects when enlarged by &epsilon;). </span></p><p class="c23"><span class="c2">SL</span><span class="c12">3</span><span class="c2">: Contains all segments, sorted increasingly on their length. </span></p><p class="c62"><span class="c2">The algorithm proceeds iteratively, considering in each iteration either the next cell from SL</span><span class="c12">1 </span><span class="c2">or the next segment from SL</span><span class="c12">2 </span><span class="c2">or SL</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c5">. Each source list can be accessed in a round robin fashion; the </span><span class="c2">correctness of our method is not affected by the access strategy. In practice, we alternate between SL</span><span class="c16">1 </span><span class="c5">and SL</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c5">, trying to balance the </span><span class="c2">number of segments considered from each source; each cell access results in the access of multiple segments, while each segment ac- cess causes the visit of multiple cells. We only access segments via the second source SL</span><span class="c12">2 </span><span class="c2">in the case that a few segments with a large number of neighboring cells exist. </span></p><p class="c81"><span class="c2">During the processing of k-SOI, a segment can be in three possi- ble states. Initially, a segment is unseen, meaning that the algorithm </span></p><p class="c101"><span class="c26">440 </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">has not considered it via any source. An efficient algorithm would leave many segments in the unseen phase. Then, when a segment is first retrieved, it is put into the partial state, meaning that some, but not all, POIs near it that satisfy the query have been accounted for. For each partial segment l, we maintain two pieces of infor- mation: (1) the count mass</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(l) of relevant POIs seen so far that satisfy the query, and (2) a list toV isit indicating which neighbor- ing cells (and consequently their POIs) to visit. Based on these, we can compute a lower bound on l&rsquo;s interest as: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">int(l) &ge; int</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(l) = </span><span class="c13">mass</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(l) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2&epsilon; len(l) + &pi;&epsilon;</span><span class="c0">2 </span><span class="c13">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Once all relevant POIs have been processed (equivalently, all neigh- boring cells have been visited), the segment is in the final state, where its exact interest is known. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Algorithm 1 presents the pseudocode for the </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">algorithm. During initialization, </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">prepares the three source lists. Partic- ularly, it builds SL</span><span class="c16">1 </span><span class="c5">by examining the global inverted index (lines </span><span class="c2">1&ndash;3); for the simple case of one keyword &psi;, SL</span><span class="c16">1 </span><span class="c5">is essentially the </span><span class="c2">inverted list I[&psi;]. Moreover, source list SL</span><span class="c12">3 </span><span class="c2">corresponds to the list of segments, while SL</span><span class="c16">2 </span><span class="c5">is extracted from the augmented segment- </span><span class="c2">to-cell map (lines 4&ndash;7). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Then, </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">proceeds to the main filtering phase (lines 8&ndash;24), where segments from the source lists are examined until the ter- mination condition LB</span><span class="c12">k </span><span class="c2">&ge; UB holds; initially LB</span><span class="c12">k </span><span class="c2">and UB are set to zero and infinity, respectively (line 9). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Assume that cell c via source list SL</span><span class="c12">1 </span><span class="c2">is to be accessed (lines 11&ndash; 15). For this cell we examine the segments that are within distance &epsilon; (lines 13&ndash;14), and for each segment we determine the number of POIs with keyword &psi; that are within distance &epsilon; so as to update their interest score given the contents of cell c. Specifically, we employ the cell-to-segment map to determine all segments L</span><span class="c12">&epsilon;</span><span class="c2">(c) that are within distance &epsilon; to cell c (line 13). For each such segment l, we invoke the procedure </span><span class="c8">UpdateInterest </span><span class="c2">(line 14), whose pseudocode is also depicted. After the procedure returns, we set the next source list to consider according to round robin (line 15). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Procedure </span><span class="c8">UpdateInterest </span><span class="c2">first checks whether cell c has been visited for l and immediately returns if so. Otherwise, it re- moves c from the toV isit list. Then it visits the local inverted index of cell c and retrieves the list for keyword &psi;. For each POI p in the list, </span><span class="c8">UpdateInterest </span><span class="c2">checks whether it is within distance &epsilon; to segment l, and if true increments mass</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(l) by one. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Now, assume that segment l is to be accessed (lines 16&ndash;21), ei- ther via source list SL</span><span class="c12">3 </span><span class="c2">or SL</span><span class="c12">2</span><span class="c2">. Its exact interest will be deter- mined, changing its state to final. Using the segment-to-cell map, we visit sequentially all neighboring cells of l, and invoke proce- dure </span><span class="c8">UpdateInterest </span><span class="c2">(lines 18&ndash;19). A cell visited during some segment access, may be again visited due to another segment&rsquo;s ac- cess or via a direct cell access via source list SL</span><span class="c12">1</span><span class="c2">. The next step is to properly set the next source list to consider (lines 20&ndash;21). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">After each access, cell or segment, algorithm </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">checks whether the termination condition applies. It first computes an upper bound UB on the interest of any unseen segment (line 22).

Due to the second case of Lemma 1, it computes the unseen interest upper bound as: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">UB = </span><span class="c13">top(SL</span><span class="c12">1</span><span class="c2">) &middot; top(SL</span><span class="c16">2</span><span class="c5">) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">2&epsilon; top(SL</span><span class="c16">3</span><span class="c5">) + &pi;&epsilon;</span><span class="c12">2 </span><span class="c13">. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">also computes a lower bound LB</span><span class="c16">k </span><span class="c5">on the interest of the k- </span><span class="c2">SOIs based on the first case of Lemma 1 (lines 23&ndash;24).

The extraction of the streets with the highest interest, i.e., the k-SOI, is then straightforward. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">A final note concerns the case of multiple keywords &Psi; in the query. The </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">algorithm changes in only two places. The first is when source list SL</span><span class="c12">1 </span><span class="c2">is built. It is necessary to account for POIs that have any keyword among those in &Psi;. </span><span class="c8">SOI </span><span class="c2">looks within the global inverted index, for each entry I[&psi;][c] corresponding to the entry for cell c in the list for keyword &psi;. This entry contains the count of POIs in cell c that have keyword &psi;. Adding these counts for all keywords provides an upper bound to the number of POIs within c that have any keyword among &Psi;. The minimum of this number and the total number |P</span><span class="c12">c</span><span class="c2">| of POIs in the cell (line 2) is then inserted into SL</span><span class="c16">1</span><span class="c5">. The second change is in the UpdateInterest </span><span class="c2">procedure.

DESCRIBING STREETS OF INTEREST </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Having identified the k-SOIs in the road network, the next step is to provide summarized information to describe them. Section 4.1 formalizes the problem, while Section 4.2 describes our solution. </span><span class="c10">4.1 Problem Definition </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">We begin by formalizing the problem, and then present details about the measures considered. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">4.1.1 Problem Statement </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">In the following, we assume an additional data source R, being a set of geo-tagged photos. Each photo r &isin; R is defined by a tuple r = &#12296;(x</span><span class="c16">r</span><span class="c5">,y</span><span class="c16">r</span><span class="c5">),&Psi;</span><span class="c16">r</span><span class="c5">&#12297;, specifying its location and a set of keywords </span><span class="c2">(its tags); the distance of a photo to a segment or a street is defined as in the case of a POI. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">To describe a SOI, we exploit its related photos. For each street s, these are the photos that are located within distance &epsilon;, i.e. R</span><span class="c12">s </span><span class="c2">= {r &isin; R : dist(r, s) &le; &epsilon;}. However, the size of R</span><span class="c16">s </span><span class="c5">can typically </span><span class="c2">be quite large. Thus, the problem is to select a relatively small sub- set of k photos (k &#8810; |R</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">|) to present as an overview for the street s. To avoid redundancy and repetition, we formulate the problem as a MaxSum diversification problem, where a subset of items is se- lected from a set in such a way as to maximize both their relevance to a given need and their pairwise dissimilarity. More formally, the problem can be defined as a bi-criteria optimization problem, aiming at optimizing an objective function F that comprises a rel- evance component and a diversity component [16, 26]. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Let R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">be a subset of R</span><span class="c16">s </span><span class="c5">of size k, and let rel(R</span><span class="c12">k</span><span class="c5">) and div(R</span><span class="c12">k</span><span class="c5">) </span><span class="c2">be two functions that measure, respectively, the relevance and the diversity of the contents of R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">. Then, the problem is to select among all possible subsets R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">the one that maximizes the function F defined as follows: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">F(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) = (1 &minus; &lambda;) &middot; rel(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) + &lambda; &middot; div(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) (2) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">where &lambda; &isin; [0,1] is a parameter determining the tradeoff between relevance (&lambda; = 0) and diversity (&lambda; = 1). </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Problem 2.

Note that the value of k throughout this section refers to the number of photos describing a street, and is thus unrelated to the value of k in Section 3 which refers to the number of SOIs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">4.1.2 Spatio-Textual Relevance and Diversity </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The function F described above provides a generic criterion for selecting a subset of items that are both relevant and diverse w.r.t. a given query. In our context, this needs to take into account both the spatial and the textual description of a street. In particular, the spatial aspect of a street s is determined by the locations of its associated photos R</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">. The textual aspect of s is captured by a keyword frequency vector &Phi;</span><span class="c16">s</span><span class="c5">, which describes the strength of each </span><span class="c2">keyword associated with s; we denote as &Psi;</span><span class="c16">s </span><span class="c5">the set of keywords </span><span class="c2">with non-zero frequency in &Phi;</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">. Note that there are many ways </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">to derive the keyword frequency vector of a street; for example, we can extract it directly from a textual description, or from the keywords of its neighboring POIs and/or photos. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">The relevance and diversity functions of a set R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">of photos should thus capture both aspects. Assuming a weight parameter 0 &le; w &le; 1 between the two aspects, we define: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">rel(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) = </span><span class="c13">w</span><span class="c2">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&sum;</span><span class="c16">r&isin;R</span><span class="c15">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_rel(r)+</span><span class="c13">1 &minus; </span><span class="c2">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">w </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&sum;</span><span class="c16">r&isin;R</span><span class="c15">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">textual_rel(r) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">(4) and </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">div(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) = k(k </span><span class="c13">2w </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&minus; 1) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&sum; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">r,r &isin;R</span><span class="c3">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_div(r, r ) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">+ </span><span class="c13">2(1 </span><span class="c2">k(k </span><span class="c13">&minus; </span><span class="c2">&minus; </span><span class="c13">w) </span><span class="c2">1) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&sum; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">r,r &isin;R</span><span class="c3">k </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">textual_div(r, r ). (5) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Notice that the relevance of set R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">is defined as the sum of the spatial and textual relevance of each photo r &isin; R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">, whereas the di- versity of R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">is the sum of the pairwise spatial and textual diversity over all photo pairs r, r &isin; R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">. To balance the different number of summands in rel(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">) and div(R</span><span class="c0">k</span><span class="c2">), we normalize them using the functions fractions that </span><span class="c12">k </span><span class="c0">1</span><span class="c2">account </span><span class="c13">and </span><span class="c12">k(k&minus;1)</span><span class="c2">for </span><span class="c0">2 </span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c13">, respectively. Next, we define the four </span><span class="c2">spatio-textual relevance and diversity. Spatial relevance and diversity. For a point query, the spatial distance of an item to the query point would typically constitute a natural way to measure relevance. However, in our case, rank- ing the photos of a street according to their distance from it does not generally provide an indicative criterion for judging relevance. Thus, we select instead a different criterion, based on spatial cov- erage. The intuition is that high density of photos in an area can be considered as an indication of &ldquo;importance&rdquo;; thus, the selection of photos should be biased towards those areas. Accordingly, we define the spatial relevance of a photo based on the number of other photos contained in its neighborhood. Furthermore, we divide this number to the total number of photos associated with the street, in order to obtain a normalized value in the range [0,1]. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">D</span><span class="c37">EFINITION </span><span class="c2">4 (S</span><span class="c37">PATIAL RELEVANCE</span><span class="c2">). Assuming a radius &rho; for the neighborhood of a photo r, we define the spatial relevance of r w.r.t. the street s as: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_rel(r) = </span><span class="c13">|{r &isin; R</span><span class="c0">s </span><span class="c13">: dist(r, </span><span class="c2">|R</span><span class="c16">s</span><span class="c5">| </span><span class="c13">r ) &le; &rho;}| </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">. (6) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The spatial diversity of a pair of photos r, r can be defined by means of their spatial distance. For normalization, we divide the distance of the pair with maxD(s), which is the largest pos- sible distance between any two photos associated with s. Value maxD(s) is computed as the length of the diagonal of the min- imum bounding rectangle, extended with a buffer of size &epsilon;, that encloses s. Thus: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">D</span><span class="c37">EFINITION </span><span class="c2">5 (S</span><span class="c37">PATIAL DIVERSITY</span><span class="c2">). We define the spatial diversity of two photos r, r associated with street s as: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_div(r, r ) = </span><span class="c13">dist(r, r </span><span class="c2">maxD(s)</span><span class="c13">) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">. (7) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Textual relevance and diversity. The textual relevance of a photo r measures the similarity of its textual description &Psi;</span><span class="c16">r </span><span class="c5">to the textual </span><span class="c2">aspect of street s as captured by its keyword frequency vector &Phi;</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c26">442 </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Next, we show how this index is used to derive lower and upper bounds for each of the components of the objective function mmr. Note that the described index, although similar to the grid index used in Section 3.2, is distinct, indexing a different dataset, i.e. the set of photos instead of POIs. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c29">4.2.2 Computing Bounds </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Using the index, we can derive, for any of the photos within a cell, upper and lower bounds for each of the components of the mmr function. The</span><span class="c8">ST_Rel+Div </span><span class="c2">algorithm exploits these bounds while computing the mmr function in order to iterate over the cells instead of individual photos and to prune the search space more quickly, identifying the next candidate that optimizes the mmr cri- terion. In particular, we need to derive lower and upper bounds for the following: (a) spatial and textual relevance of a cell to a street and (b) spatial and textual diversity of a cell to a photo. We elaborate on each below. </span></p><p class="c69"><span class="c2">Cell spatial relevance. Consider a cell c</span><span class="c16">i,j</span><span class="c5">. The spatial rele- </span><span class="c2">vance of a photo r w.r.t. street s is defined according to Equation 6. Moreover, recall that the length of each side of a cell in the spatial grid is photos in </span><span class="c0">&rho;</span><span class="c12">2</span><span class="c13">. </span><span class="c2">the </span><span class="c13">Hence, </span><span class="c2">same </span><span class="c13">each </span><span class="c2">cell </span><span class="c13">photo r &isin; c</span><span class="c12">i,j</span><span class="c2">.R covers at least all other and at most all photos that are no more than two cells away. Accordingly, we derive the following lower and upper bounds for the cell-to-street spatial relevance: </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_rel</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(c</span><span class="c16">i,j</span><span class="c5">) = </span><span class="c2">|c|R</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">| </span><span class="c16">i,j</span><span class="c5">.R| </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c13">, (11) </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">spatial_rel</span><span class="c0">+</span><span class="c2">(c</span><span class="c16">i,j</span><span class="c5">) = </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">&sum; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12">&#8710;i,&#8710;j&isin;[&minus;2,2] </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">|c</span><span class="c12">i+&#8710;i,j+&#8710;j</span><span class="c2">.R| </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">|R</span><span class="c12">s</span><span class="c2">| </span><span class="c13">. (12) </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">Cell textual relevance. Consider a cell c. The textual relevance of a photo r &isin; c.R w.r.t. street s is defined according to Equa- tion 8. We seek to construct keyword sets &Psi;</span><span class="c0">&minus;</span><span class="c2">(c|s),&Psi;</span><span class="c0">+</span><span class="c2">(c|s), which are subsets of c.&Psi;, such that when they substitute set &Psi;</span><span class="c12">r </span><span class="c2">in Equation 8, the obtained values bound the textual relevance of any photo r &isin; c.R.

It builds the diversified set R</span><span class="c0">k </span><span class="c2">iteratively, selecting at each step the photo that maximizes the maximum marginal relevance function mmr (see Section 2). Suppose that set R has been constructed, where |R| &lt; k.

A na&iuml;ve im- plementation would compute a large number of spatial and textual photo-to-street relevances and photo-to-photo diversities.

EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">We have conducted an experimental evaluation using real-world data comprising road networks, POIs and photos. The datasets cover the areas of three European capital cities, London, Berlin and Vienna, and were collected from various Web sources, in particular: (a) road networks from OpenStreetMap, (b) POIs from DBpedia, OpenStreetMap, Wikimapia and Foursquare, and (c) photos from Flickr and Panoramio. Table 1 presents statistics about the datasets. All algorithms were implemented in Java and experiments were run on a machine with an Intel Core i7 2400 CPU and 8GB RAM. </span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c2">The primary focus of this paper is to propose efficient algorithms for the tasks of identifying and describing SOIs, as defined in Sec- tions 3.1 and 4.1. A detailed performance study is presented in Section 5.2. Nonetheless, it is also very important to gauge the ef- fectiveness of our methods in achieving their goals.

The ranked list is shown in the first column of Table 2. Streets that are common among the 10-SOIs and the two sources are shown in bold. For both sources, we retrieve 4 out of 5 streets; therefore, our method has a recall (at rank 10) of 0.8. </span></p><p class="c148"><span class="c2">A closer inspection of the results though, suggests that our method has actually better recall (and precision). All streets included in Ta- ble 2 belong to one of four main shopping sites in Berlin, near Al- te/Neue Sch&ouml;nhauser Stra&szlig;e, near Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, near Friedrich- stra&szlig;e, and near Potsdamer Platz. Figure 2 illustrates the first three areas on the map (the last one is a public square that has no impor- tant adjacent shopping streets) and highlights the streets included in Table 2. Green color indicates that the street is in the 10-SOIs and in at least one of the source lists (true positives); orange means it is in the 10-SOIs but not in any source (false positives); blue indicates it is in a source but not in the 10-SOIs (false negatives). </span></p><p class="c150"><span class="c2">It should be apparent that all orange streets near Alte/Neue Sch&ouml;n- hauser Stra&szlig;e are actually valid results as they are adjacent to the main streets in the respective area, and further have lots of little shops in their vicinity. Similarly, the orange street near Friedrich- stra&szlig;e is also valid as it is a pedestrian undergound tunnel with shops. Regarding the blue streets in the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm site (which is analogous to Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es in Paris), we should note that Kur- f&uuml;rstendamm appears in the 20-SOIs. The reason they are ranked lower is that in their vicinity the density of shops is lower, as they essentially house big luxury brands. This could be addressed by ex- ploiting additional metadata to assign different weights to the POIs. </span></p><p class="c137"><span class="c12">1</span><span class="c58">http://www.tripadvisor.com/Travel-g187323-s405/ </span><span class="c24">Berlin:Germany:Shopping.html </span><span class="c12">2</span><span class="c58">http://www.globalblue.com/destinations/germany/ </span><span class="c24">berlin/top-five-shopping-streets-in-berlin </span></p><p class="c1 c56"><span class="c29">5.1.2 Describing Streets of Interest </span></p><p class="c70"><span class="c2">To study the effectiveness of our method in selecting appropri- ate photos for describing a particular SOI, we focus on the popular Oxford Street in London and seek for 3 photos. Since deriving the ground truth from the collected crowd-sourced data is not possi- ble, we choose to empirically test the result of our method against simpler techniques that select photos based on spatial, textual in- formation or their combination, and consider relevance, diversity, or their combination. More precisely, we compare our method </span><span class="c8">ST_Rel+Div </span><span class="c2">that combines spatio-textual relevance and diver- sity, against 8 other techniques depicted in Table 4. Symbols S and T denote, respectively, that spatial and textual information is considered, while Rel and Div indicate, respectively, that relevance and diversity are taken into account; our method considers all fac- tors and information, hence its name </span><span class="c8">ST_Rel+Div</span><span class="c2">. </span></p><p class="c30"><span class="c2">For a visual inspection of the results, Figure 3 shows the 3-photo summary of Oxford Street, according to methods S_Rel, T_Rel and </span><span class="c8">ST_Rel+Div</span><span class="c2">, respectively. In the first method, all selected pho- tos are located outside HMV, an entertainment retailing company, and are in fact near-duplicates. The reason for this seems to be that the particular location attracts a large number of photos, due to the release of popular movies, music albums and other similar events, thus creating a high density spot. For the second method, all results are photos from a particular demonstration that took place along Oxford Street. This bias was introduced due to the high frequency of the corresponding tags, thus resulting in a higher rank for photos having those tags. On the other hand, observe that in our method (Figure 3(c)) the result comprises different kinds of photos, achiev- ing both high relevance and diversity: one photo outside HMV, another from the aforementioned demonstration, and a third photo showing a view of the street undergoing construction work. </span></p><p class="c108"><span class="c2">For a quantifiable measure of effectiveness, we use the objective function of Equation 2 (&lambda; = 0.5, w = 0.5), that provides a bal- anced score reflecting the relevance and diversity of both spatial and textual information included in the photo summary.

Throughout our experiments, we set the distance threshold &epsilon; to a fixed value (&epsilon; = 0.0005</span><span class="c0">&#9702; </span><span class="c2">&asymp; 55m). We study the effect of the number k of SOIs requested, and the number |&Psi;| of keywords in the query. To construct the keyword set, we se- lect the first |&Psi;| keywords among {religion, education, food, services}. The resulting accumulated number of relevant POIs is shown in Table 4. In each experiment, we vary one parameter while setting the other to its default value (k = 50, |&Psi;| = 3). </span></p><p class="c117"><span class="c2">Table 4: Relevant POIs according to |&Psi;|. </span><span class="c25">Dataset </span><span class="c24">|</span><span class="c25">&Psi;</span><span class="c24">| </span><span class="c25">= 1 </span><span class="c24">|</span><span class="c25">&Psi;</span><span class="c24">| </span><span class="c25">= 2 </span><span class="c24">|</span><span class="c25">&Psi;</span><span class="c24">| </span><span class="c25">= 3 </span><span class="c24">|</span><span class="c25">&Psi;</span><span class="c24">| </span><span class="c25">= 4 </span></p><p class="c46"><span class="c25">London 10,445 32,682 113,211 202,127 Berlin 1,969 10,506 47,950 78,310 Vienna 1,678 7,660 25,695 41,484 </span></p><p class="c65"><span class="c2">Metrics.

As we go from bottom left to top right, the value &lambda; increases from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.25, and thus relevance decreases while diversity increases. The larger marker indicates the value &lambda; = 0.5. In all cities, &lambda; values around 0.5 achieve the best relevance-diversity trade-off. For example, in Vi- enna &lambda; = 0.5 suggests that by sacrificing 0.22 units of normalized relevance we achieve a diversity of 0.87 normalized units. These findings justify our selection of 0.5 as the default value for &lambda;. Metrics.

In fact, the execution time is much higher for London, due to the fact that the selected segment in that case has a much higher number of associated photos, while the inverse holds for Berlin. </span></p><p class="c1 c111"><span class="c2">In this paper, we have addressed the problem of finding and exploring Streets of Interest based on Points of Interest and pho- tos characterized by geolocation and keywords. The problem ad- dressed is twofold. Given a set of keywords, we first rank streets according to relevant nearby POIs. To that end, we define an inter- est score for a street, and we present an efficient algorithm that re- turns the top-k interesting streets. Then, we select for each discov- ered street a small, diversified set of photos. We formulate this as a diversification problem for spatio-textual objects, and we present an efficient algorithm that performs a greedy search using a spatio- textual grid to speed up the selection of candidates. Our experimen- tal results on real-world data from several Web sources show that the proposed algorithms drastically reduce the computation time, allowing for online discovery and exploration of interesting parts of the road network. In the future, we plan to enhance the diversi- fication criteria with visual features extracted from the photos, as well as to provide route recommendations based on the discovered streets of interest. </span><span class="c10">Acknowledgements </span><span class="c5">This work was partially supported by the EU Projects GEOSTREAM </span><span class="c2">(FP7-SME-2012-315631) and City.Risks (H2020-FCT-2014-653747). </span><span class="c10">7.
